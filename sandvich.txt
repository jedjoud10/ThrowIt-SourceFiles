[Two slices of the Sandvich are in a refrigerator on a plate beside three bottles of Red Shed beer]
["Meet the Sandvich" text appears]

[Cut back to the Sandviches]

Heavy: [Groans repeatedly]

Scout: "Yeah, there he is!"

Soldier: "You! Stop right where you are, that is an order! He's getting away! Do not let him get to the re-"

[The Heavy opens the door, grabs one slice of the Sandvich and closes the door]

Scout: "D-don't do it, pal!"

Soldier: "Do. Not. Do it!"

Heavy: [Eats sandvich] "Om nom nom nom..."

Soldier: "Oohhhhhhh, hell..."

Scout: [Stuttering]"H-h-hey, let's just calm down here! You listening? J-j-just... OH GOD!"

[The Heavy chuckles as his loud footsteps are heard gathering speed]

Scout: "OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GO-"

[Several loud thuds are heard, a beer bottle falls over, and the refrigerator door opens slightly]

Heavy: "Ahahahaha!"

[Sound of liquid spilling on the floor, presumably the Scout's blood]

Scout: "My blood! H-he punched out all my blood!"

[More thuds are heard.]

Soldier: "Ow, ow ow ow ow! Ouch, ouch! Ahhh..."

[A thud and a snap is heard]

Soldier: "You call that breaking my spine? You RED team ladies wouldn't know how to break a spine if-"

[A loud snap is heard and the door closes and opens again, the floor now covered with blood and another one of the bottles of beer falls over]

Soldier: "AUGHHH! MY SPINE!"

[A girlish scream is heard as ending flourish music plays. The camera pans across a diagram of the Sandvich]

[Cut to the Heavy in Dustbowl, as he was in the original Meet the Heavy, but instead of wielding his Minigun he is devouring a Sandvich]

Heavy: "Nom nom nom... [Takes a bite] nom nom... mmmm.. nom."
